description:
	you can just type "roslaunch homework20150422 see_your_face.launch" in your terminal to see what's always following you quietly wherever you go.

	ok, this is a joke. I just erased the rectangle and drew some circle on the image.

the following 2 files were created:
launch/see_your_face.launch
scripts/test.py

and the folowing file has been modified:
README.md
